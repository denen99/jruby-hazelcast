INSTALLING THE JRUBY-HAZELCAST GEM

1) jgem install jruby-hazelcast

2) paste the following code into a file called 'test.rb':

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
require 'java'
require 'rubygems'
require 'jruby-hazelcast'

key = rand
value = rand 

c = HazelcastCacheClient.instance
c.put(key,value)

resp = c.get(key)

if resp == value 
  puts "READ / WRITE WORKS !!"
else
  puts "Something went wrong !!"
end

c.client.shutdown
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


3)  start a hazelcast instance.  If you do not know how to do this, simply download the latest version of hazelcast, cd into the "bin/" directory and run the script "./run.sh"


4) Run the test script by simply doing "jruby test.rb" from the command line, and you should see the "READ / WRITE WORKS" output to confirm everything is working as expected
